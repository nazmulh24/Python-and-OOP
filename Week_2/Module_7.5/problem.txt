1 --> Write what is meant by operator overloading and method overriding with examples.

    
    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name, age, height, weight) -> None:
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            self.height = height
            self.weight = weight

    class Cricketer(Person):
        def __init__(self, name, age, height, weight) -> None:
            super().__init__(name, age, height, weight)

    sakib = Cricketer('Sakib', 38, 68, 91)
    musfiq = Cricketer('Rahim', 36, 68, 88)
    kamal = Cricketer('Kamal', 39, 68, 94)
    jack = Cricketer('Jack', 38, 68, 91)
    kalam = Cricketer('Kalam', 37, 68, 95)

2 --> Find out which of these players is older using the operator overloading.


3 --> Write down 4 differences between the class method and static method with proper examples.

4 --> Write what are getter and setter with proper examples

5 --> Explain the difference between inheritance and composition with proper examples.
